0x0C. Python - Almost a circle
0. Files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.
1. Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package
2. Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base
3. Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)
4. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
5. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.
6. Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
7. Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
8. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute
9. Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes
10. Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle
11. Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size
12. Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes
13. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle
14. Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square
15. JSON is one of the standard formats for sharing data representation.
16. Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file.
17. Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string.
18. Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set
19. Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances.
20. Update the class Base by adding the class methods def save_to_file_csv(cls, list_objs): and def load_from_file_csv(cls): that serializes and deserializes in CSV
21. Update the class Base by adding the static method def draw(list_rectangles, list_squares): that opens a window and draws all the Rectangles and Squares
